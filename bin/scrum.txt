%MAIN% report <scrum> [options]
%MAIN% help
%MAIN% get-projects
%MAIN% get-cards <scrum>

report is the primary interface, it will print scrum reports.

help is the default command, it prints a usage message.

Options:
  -c,--closed       Report only closed issues, not in-progress or backlogged.
  -i,--issues       Print the repo/number of each issue after the title.
  -f,--from N       Report from sprint N onwards, instead of current sprint.
  -m,--milestone M  Limit report to issues from milestone M (will also include
                    the backlog for this milestone).


Authentication:

Either create a `.auth.json` file in the CWD with your github username/password:

    { "username": "...", "password": "..." }

Or provide `GITHUB_USERNAME` and `GITHUB_PASSWORD` in the environment.


Maintenance:

get-projects needs to be done to update the local list of source repos for each
of the scrum boards.

get-cards needs to be done to update the local list of waffle size estimates
for issues. It should probably be done after sprint planning.
